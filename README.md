# Shrek 2 Modding SDK
This repository consists of the Shrek 2 Modding SDK, used to create and play mods. This SDK was built for simplicity and easy use so anyone with basic understanding and knowledge of C++ can get started and make mods for Shrek 2.

# How to Get Started
- Documentation is currently being developed. If you already have created a mod and wanna publish it, go to https://shrek2mods.com/ and Login with Discord to add your mod. Your mod will need to be verified by an Admin tho before it becomes available for everyone in the Shrek 2 Mod Manager.
